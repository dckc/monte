Introduction

Why Monte?
----------

Don't we have enough languages already? This is a fair question.  Here we'll
explain why we created Monte and what's interesting about it.


Because Security Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Secure distributed computing should not be hard**. Computers are getting
faster, smaller, more connected, and more capable, but when it comes to
security, `everything is broken`__. A major cause is the "water balloon"
design philosophy of contemporary languages and frameworks: Security is only
enforced at the edges of programs, and not within the structure of programs
themselves. Monte takes the object-capability paradigm of E [#]_ and
expands on the approach, delivering a powerful and expressive language.

.. sidebar:: Can we reuse existing languages?

    Disciplined use of existing languages such as Java and ECMAScript can be
    used to build object capability systems, but the standard practices and
    libraries are not compatible with this discipline. We believe that nothing
    short of a capability-safe-by-construction language can enforce capability
    discipline.

Monte, like E before it, has dramatic advantages for secure distributed
systems:

   - Capability-based security enables the concise composition of powerful
     patterns of interoperation--patterns that enable extensive cooperation
     even in the presence of severely limited trust.

   - Monte promises benefit from a *promise-pipelining* architecture which
     ensures that *most deadlocks cannot occur*. [*]_

   - Monte offers cryptographic services directly to its users, easing the use
     of good cryptographic primitives.


Because Readability Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sidebar:: The origin of Monte's name

   The Monte language has its roots in the E and Python languages. We
   took "Monty" from "Monty Python", and put an "e" in there. Thus,
   "Monte".

Monte wraps its strengths in a Python-like syntax to make it quickly
comfortable for a large number of software engineers.

Monte is a pure object-based language in the Smalltalk tradition, making it
easy to write modular, readable, maintainable software using the strategies
familiar from Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, and other object-based
languages.  All values are objects and all computation is done by sending
messages to objects. It has the kind of powerful string handling that will be
recognized and seized upon by the Perl hacker.

Because Stability Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte is dynamically typed [#unityped]_, like Smalltalk, rather than
statically typed, like Java. Users of Perl and Python will immediately
recognize this is an advantage; Java and C++ programmers may not be so
sure. Fortunately, Monte inherits two forms of contract-based programming from
E: :ref:`guards<guards>` and :ref:`interfaces<interfaces>`.

Monte is dynamic in three ways:

Dynamic Typing
    The type of a variable might not be known until runtime, and "types are
    open".
Dynamic Binding
    It is possible to pass a message to an object that will never able to
    handle that message. This provides a late-binding sort of polymorphism.
Dynamic Compiling
    Monte can compile and run Monte code at runtime, as part of its core
    runtime.

While "arbitrary code execution" is a notorious security vulnerability, Monte
enables the fearless yet powerful use of multi-party limited-trust mobile
code.

.. _ocap:

Object Capability Discipline
----------------------------

A :dfn:`capability` is a reference to an object and represents authority to
invoke methods on the object. The key to supporting dynamic code execution
without vulnerability is :dfn:`object capability discipline`, which consists
of:

Memory safety and encapsulation
  There is no way to get a reference to an object except by creating one or
  being given one at creation or via a message; no casting integers to
  pointers, for example.

  From outside an object, there is no way to access the internal state of the
  object without the object's consent (where consent is expressed by
  responding to messages).
Primitive effects only via references
  The only way an object can affect the world outside itself is via references
  to other objects. All primitives for interacting with the external world are
  embodied by primitive objects and anything globally accessible is immutable
  data. There is no ``open(filename)`` function in the global namespace, nor
  can such a function be imported. The runtime passes all such objects to an
  :ref:`entrypoint<entrypoints>`, which then explicitly delegates to other
  objects.

We'll demonstrate how this leads to natural expression of the *Principle of
Least Power* briefly in :ref:`taste` and in more detail in
:ref:`secure_distributed_computing`.


Why not Monte?
--------------

Monte assumes automatic memory management; the current reference
implementation uses the PyPy garbage collector, and any other implementation
will have to choose a similar scheme. As such, it is not a good language for
low level machine manipulation. So do not try to use Monte for writing device
drivers.

Monte's performance is currently quite unfavorable compared to raw C, and
additionally, Monte's target niches are largely occupied by other dynamic
languages with JIT-compiler-based runtimes, so it is not a design goal to
compete with C or other memory-unsafe languages.

.. note:: While Monte's usable and most architectural issues are resolved, it
          is still undergoing rapid development. See :ref:`roadmap` for
          details.


Getting Started
---------------

Quick Start Docker Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Docker installed, the quickest way to get to an interactive prompt
to run some Monte code is ``docker run -it montelang/repl``. This container
provides the essentials needed for most examples in this documentation.

A container with a shell and the full set of Monte development tools is
available on Docker Hub as well, ``montelang/monte-dev``.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to use Docker, the other supported environment requires the
packaging/build tool `Nix`_. It can be installed on Linux and OSX from their
installer script::

    curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

Alternately, you can `install it manually`__ from tarball, DEB, RPM, etc.

.. _`Nix`: http://nixos.org/nix/
__ http://nixos.org/releases/nix/latest/

From Source
+++++++++++

Builds of Monte from source are straightforward, using Nix::

    git clone https://github.com/monte-language/typhon/
    nix-env -f typhon -iA monte

From Cachix
+++++++++++

One of our community members maintains a `Cachix`_ instance. Instructions are
at the `Monte Cachix`_ page.

Once that's set up, you can install Monte by running::

    nix-env -i monte

.. _`Cachix`: https://cachix.org/

Interacting with the Monte REPL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte has a traditional "Read - Evaluate - Print Loop", or REPL, for
exploration. Invoke it as ``monte repl``. For example::

  >>> 1 + 1
  2

  >>> "abc".size()
  3


Getting Help about an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monte strives to provide useful error messages and self-documenting objects::

  â–²> help(Ref)
  Result: Object type: RefOps
  Ref management and utilities.
  Method: broken/1
  Method: isBroken/1
  Method: isDeepFrozen/1
  ...
