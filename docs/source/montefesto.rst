Contributing
============

If you'd like to get involved with developing or using the Monte language,
start by getting in touch with us on IRC. It is useful, but not necessary, to
be acquainted with Python_'s syntax and/or the computational concepts of E_.

Then clone the repo_ and follow the directions below to begin running Monte
code. If you have problems, join us in #monte on irc.freenode.net, ask your
question (use a pastebin_ to share any errors, rather than pasting into the
channel), and wait a few hours if nobody is around. 

If you'd like to contribute to Monte, check out the Monte_ and Typhon_ issue
trackers. It's also worth grepping for ``TODO`` in the source of both
projects.
